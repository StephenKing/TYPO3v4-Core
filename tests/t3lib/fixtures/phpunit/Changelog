	* Fixed bug where phpunit could get stuck with 'Extension not loaded [...]'. Now, instead phpunit will default to extension key 'phpunit', if the chosen key does not exist anymore (which can happen if the extension is removed).

06. May 2008: 3.2.20
	~ Changed hook key in mod1/index.php (by request).

24. April 2008: 3.2.19

	~ Updated manual to include a section about Typo3 unit testing helper classes (specifically: oelib).

07. April 2008: 3.2.16

	~ Re-inserted $backupGlobals = false.

	- Removed setting $backupGlobals=false. This should be unnecessary after PHPUnit issue #421 was solved, http://www.phpunit.de/ticket/421.
	* Bugfix: Commented out calls to Graphviz. This is a future feature, that had sneaked in prematurely, causing fatal error for users. Closes issue #8037, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=8037.

	+ Added re-run icon to each test: Clicking it, will re-run that test only. Closes issue #6972, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6972 (does not work with Experimental UI).
	+ Added NEWS file to end of 'About PHPUnit BE', to make it easier to access.
	+ Added option 'alwaysSimulateFrontendEnvironment' which defaults to true, since that is backwards compatible.
	+ Added method 'simulateFrontendEnvironment()' to tx_phpunit_testcase class. Call this method to load a (simple) simulation of the FE environment.
	+ Added lib/ directory. Might be removed later, let's see...
	- Removed clear.gif.
	+ Added icon mod1/runner.gif
	* Made all files follow the GT3 coding conventions (a derivative of Typo3 CGL, but not a subset).

29. March 2008: Version 3.2.6

	+ Added PHPUnit 3.2.17, see Changelog at http://phpunit.de/wiki/ChangeLog32#PHPUnit3.2.1729-Mar-2008
	- Removed PHPUnit 3.2.16.

27. March 2008: Version 3.2.5
	+ Added new UI for running tests: You will need to set the new option ' Experimental test interface' in the Extension Manager (EM).  This adresses issue #6965, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6965. Thanks to Mikkel Ricky who provided the new implementation.

24. March 2008: Version 3.2.4
	+ Experimental support for Code Coverage reporting. Turned of by default, since you need to setup XDebug and it slows down unit testing considerably!
	+ Previously there was a total timelimit of 30 seconds. Now the timelimit is per testcase; this is done by inserting a call to set_time_limit(30) in the testlistener.
	+ Expanded 'About PHPUnit BE': Added links to bugs.typo3.org and phpunit on typo3xdev.sf.net. Added SÃ¸ren Soltveit to contributor list. Added test for XDebug extension (needed for code coverage) and test for memory limit, which should be set to something like 256MB, when using code coverage!
	+ New (experimental) progressbar: First stab at bugs #6972 and #6975. Turned off by default. Works badly: Overflows to the right, when there are many tests.
	+ Added PHPUnit 3.2.16, see Changelog at http://www.phpunit.de/wiki/ChangeLog32#PHPUnit3.2.1622-Mar-2008.
	+ Removed PHPUnit 3.2.15.

18. March 2008: Version 3.2.3
	+ New helper functions in tx_phpunit_testcase: You can now use the Typo3 database from your tests. E.g. for creating new tables for your tests. Reminder: Never run tests in a production environment.
	+ Tests for new helper functions added in class database_testcase. Note: You will need to manually install the four extensions named 'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc' and 'ddd' (they can be found in tests/res/).

19. December 2007: Version 3.2.2
	~ Changed header in BE module: It now writes the version string from the PHPUnit currently in use. This makes it easier to verify that the correct version is used. Closes http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6985
	* Removed white background from phpunit-be.css.
	* Changed path in ext_localconf.php to uppercase. Solves problem, where using the shipped PHPUnit did not work on systems where upper case / lower case is respected (e.g. Linux systems).

17. December 2007: Version 3.2.1 - The 'Remember PEAR file structure!' release.
	* Moved files in PHPUnit-3.2.6 directory to a PHPUnit sub-directory. Closes http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6994

	~ Bumped version number, since phpunit now ships with PHPUnit version 3.2.6
	+ Added a NEWS file, which holds the info which was previously in the Changelog file.
	~ Changed the Changelog file to hold Subversion commits. This is meant to be added by a pre-commit hook on svn, when extension development is moved to typo3xdev.sf.net.

	+ Added German translation, thanks to Mario Rimann :-)

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.13

	~ Updated manual to mention pear integration and made the Changelog current (and updated index).

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.12
	+ Added 'Exclude extensions' option in extension manager setup. This allows you to set extension that phpunit should never search for tests (also applies to 'out of line'-paths).
	+ Added info about currently excluded extensions to 'About phpunit BE' submodule.

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.11
	* Two identically named tests in different testsuites are now distinguished.
	* Having the same extension installed as both local and global now works: Tests in the active one is run.

15. October 2007: Version 3.1.10
	+ Added 'out-of-line' tests: These are tests that are now in the extension itself, but found on a path you give in the extension manager.
	+ Added information notice to eAccelerator 0.9.5.1 users about optimizer bug in eAccelerator.
	+ Added 'Contributors' section to About box.

	* Corrected logo image display in About box.

	+ Added extension manager configuration option to point to another PHPUnit, than the one provided by the extension (could be a PEAR installed PHPUnit).
	+ Added PHPUnit version 3.1.9
	+ Added PHPUnit version 3.0.6: You must provide the absolute path to it in the extension manager conf (including ending slash) to use this version.
	- Removed PHPUnit version 3.0.5

	~ Changed version number to 3.1.9.
	~ Changed state to beta.
	~ Changed ChangeLog Legend and updated the complete file to reflect this.
	* Corrected the way the lib is found: Now you only have do do it in one place. Note that PHPUnit is expected to be in a sub-directory called 'PHPUnit' of the place you write.
	* Corrected the progressbar, so now it stays within the browser window (Thanks to Mikkel Ricky for the fix :-)
	* Corrected a bug, where an error about class tx_t3unit_testcase was spewed (Thanks to Mario Rimann for pointing out and Mikkel Ricky for fixing).

13. March 2007: Version 3.0.52
	+ Added class tx_t3unit_testcase for providing backwards compatibility with t3unit (suggested by Robert Lemke).
